# GlitchEnsemble

_GlitchEnsemble_ is an open source internet art experiment built on Processing.js, HTML5, CSS3 and other technologies. This web application is mainly inspired by http://www.patatap.com and the glitch art movement. It allows you to press certain computer keys to launch sound and visuals. The purpose of this application is to increase awareness of creative coding methods and inspire their use in mainstream development. Glitch Ensemble may also be used as a reference and starting point for others interested in the Processing programming language. The application will be constantly evolving and is open to any ideas from the community. 

It is released under an MIT-style license.
